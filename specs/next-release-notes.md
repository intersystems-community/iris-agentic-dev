# Next release notes (staging)

Baseline: v1.6.3, whose notes are final in `docs/release-notes/v1.6.3.md`. What follows is
staged for the release after it.

I add an entry here as each user-facing change lands, so release notes are not
reconstructed from `git log` at tag time. At release time this drains into
`docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, which is what `docs/release-checklist.md` step 4 gates on
and what becomes the GitHub release body via `gh release edit <tag> --notes`. The VS Code
extension's `CHANGELOG.md` is built from those files (#136).

Rules for anything written here:

- Keep the three sections below, in this order, and end the drained file with a
  `vX.Y.Z...vA.B.C` compare link.
- Internal-only work (refactors, test infrastructure, CI) stays out unless a caller can
  observe the difference.
- Name the tool, flag, or file and give the number. "Improved performance" is not an entry;
  "suite went from 254 s to 61 s" is.
- Run `/no-ai-slop` detect on the drained file and fix every finding before publishing.
- First person singular. This is a one-person project.
